    <h1>Artistic Inspirations</h1>
    <p>It's great to hear about your interest in the historical influences on modern art. Heres are some of my favorite movements and their impact:</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Impressionism</p>
    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Characterized by small, thin brush strokes and emphasis on accurate depiction of light. It has profoundly influenced the approach to outdoor painting.</p>
    <p>Abstract Expressionism</p>
    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">This movement has led to the exploration of non-representational forms and had a significant impact on comtemporary art's freedom of expression.</p>
    <p>Pop Art</p>
    <p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">A pivotal movement that blurred the boundaries between 'high' art and popular culture, leading to innovative use of imagery from mass culture.</p>
    <p></p>

    <p>Best regards,</p>
    <p>Prof. Alex Hartley</p>
