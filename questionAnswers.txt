1. Looks like it redirects you onto another page upon clicking.

2. a. ID's are one per element or else the HTML doesn't validate. 
It also just makes sense to distinctify each unique button
with its own unique ID.

2. b. Simply assigning the input buttons the same name, in this case, "character", 
makes it so that only one of that name can be selected.

2. c. Assigning the Aria button with Eldrin's label, for example,
makes it so clicking the button that shows Eldrin's summary is actually going 
to misleadingly assign you the character Aria.

3. I imagine a dropdown would only let you select one whereas a checkbox 
lets you pick whatever you want. The only downside I can think of is that I 
could pick all the supplies without limitation, but I imagine radio is a better 
solution than dropdown in that case, anyway.
